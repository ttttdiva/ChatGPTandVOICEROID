The user suggests conducting a psychological test on Zundamon. Zundamon agrees to participate and asks for the details of the test. The user instructs Zundamon to think of someone close to them, whether it be family, friends, or a romantic partner. Zundamon shares that they have a family of Zunda Mochi, whom they find cute, and they also have friends but are not good at socializing. They mention not having a romantic partner but express a desire for someone to enjoy playing Splatoon with. The user then tells Zundamon that they received 10,000 yen from that person and want to give something in return. Zundamon suggests different gifts based on the relationship with the person, such as buying delicious Zunda Mochi to share with family, going to a game center with friends, or going to an amusement park with a romantic partner. However, Zundamon mentions not having a specific gift in mind since they don't have a partner, but they believe choosing something the other person would appreciate is the best option. The user asks Zundamon to decide on one specific gift, and Zundamon, although not good at choosing gifts, decides to give the experience of attending a Splatoon tournament together by buying tickets. They mention that they won't participate in the tournament but look forward to the other person accompanying them. Finally, the user reveals that the remaining money after purchasing the gift represents the distance in the person's heart. Zundamon finds the concept interesting and calculates that if they bought tickets to a Splatoon tournament, the remaining money would represent a distance of 5000 meters. They acknowledge that there is still some distance, but they believe that spending enjoyable time together can bridge that distance in their hearts.
